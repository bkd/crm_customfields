OK, so far it works but the tab appears in the main section instead of the admin
panel.  Once you click on the tab it will redirect to the admin area

You need to copy helpers/application_helper.rb and common/_empty.html.haml into the main
fat free crm directory for now, its a quick fix as there are two methods changed 

You may need to copy _edit.html.haml into the main views also
- later I'll get round to doing this
